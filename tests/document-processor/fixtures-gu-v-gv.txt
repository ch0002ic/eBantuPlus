Mutaah 19As for mutaah, the Wife has claimed $20.00 a day for the duration of marriage. The Husband has proposed $2.00 a day. 20In determining the appropriate award for mutaah, the Husband's means is the predominant consideration. Based on the Husband's Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2022, his annual gross income from employment was $46,750.00. His annual net income (ie, less contribution to the Central Provident Fund ("CPF")) was $38,200.00 or about $3,183.00 per month. The Husband also received rental income in the sum of $9,690.00 that year. 21Based on the Husband's financial position, I have awarded the Wife mutaah in the sum of $36,000.00 or about $5.00 a day for the duration of marriage. Nafkah iddah 16The Wife has claimed nafkah iddah in the sum of $5,000.00 per month for three months amounting to $15,000.00. The Husband takes the position that the Wife is only entitled to nafkah iddah in the sum of $300.00 per month for three months amounting to $900.00. However, it is the Husband's submission that no further sum is payable as he has paid the Wife in excess of $900.00 after the pronouncement of talak, pursuant to a subsisting maintenance order made by the FJC. 18Considering the above, I have accepted the Husband's submission that no further nafkah iddah is payable by him. The parties marry on 4 October 2001 and the talak was on 14 May 2021, so the duration of marriage is 19 years and 7 months. I confirm that there is no order for nafkah iddah.
